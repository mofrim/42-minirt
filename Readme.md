## Features we implemented

- Interactive UI with ability to move through the scene and control over scene
  parameters like cam fov, ambient light brightness, sub- and supersampling
  level and some more.
- Toggable sidebar for info display
- Objects: plane, sphere, cylinder, triangle, circle, hyperboloid (also gives
  the cone).
- Texture / Bump / Normal mapping: Fully implemented for the sphere, for the
  hyper only texture mapping.
- Checker pattern mapping: sphere, hyper and plane.
- Switchable raytracing method: direct single pixel drawing to he canvas,
  drawing via xpm, multithreaded variants.
- Multithreading is also available for supersampling.

## Learnings

You gotta stop implementing features at some point... :)
